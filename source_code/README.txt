The source code consists of two parts, the server and the client. The applications can be compiled and packed in executable JAR files. The existing JAR files were compiled and packed using JDK 16. All the JAR files are stored in the application folder. They can be recompiled by run makejar.bat(Windows) or makejar.sh(Linux) in the folder. The JAR file will be automatically generated.
